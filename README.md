To run the code, you need to add your Infura endpoint in the file data/endpoint.dat and your private key in the file data/key.dat.

The test contract is already deployed on the testnet (contract address is in data/address.dat) and you can interact with it by running call_functions.py and passing as a command line argument the value you want to send to the contract.
